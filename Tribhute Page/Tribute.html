    <p id="tribute-info" class="tg"> David Hilbert, (23 January 1862 – 14 February 1943) was a German mathematician and one of the most influential mathematicians of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Hilbert discovered and developed a broad range of fundamental ideas in many areas, including invariant theory, the calculus of variations, commutative algebra, algebraic number theory, the foundations of geometry, spectral theory of operators and its application to integral equations, mathematical physics, and the foundations of mathematics (particularly proof theory).
    <ul id="ull">
      <li> Hilbert adopted and defended Georg Cantor's set theory and transfinite numbers. </li>
      <li> In 1900, he presented a collection of problems that set the course for much of the mathematical research of the 20th century. </li>
      <li> Hilbert and his students contributed significantly to establishing rigor and developed important tools used in modern mathematical physics.</li>
      <li> Hilbert is known as one of the founders of proof theory and mathematical logic. </li>
      <li>John von Neumann was his assistant.</li>
      <li> Hilbert was editor of the Mathematische Annalen, the leading mathematical journal of the time.</li>
      <li>When Galileo Galilei was criticized for failing to stand up for his convictions on the Heliocentric theory, Hilbert objected: "But [Galileo] was not an idiot. Only an idiot could believe that scientific truth needs martyrdom; that may be necessary in religion, but scientific results prove themselves in due time."</li>
      <li> Until 1912, Hilbert was almost exclusively a "pure" mathematician. In 1912, Hilbert turned his focus to Physics exclusively. He arranged to have a "physics tutor" for himself. He continued seminars and classes where the works of Albert Einstein and others were followed closely. </li>
      <li> By 1907, Einstein had framed the fundamentals of the theory of gravity, but then struggled for nearly 8 years with a confounding problem of putting the theory into final form. By early summer 1915, Hilbert's interest in physics had focused on general relativity, and he invited Einstein to Göttingen to deliver a week of lectures on the subject. Einstein received an enthusiastic reception at Göttingen. </li>
      <li> Over the summer, Einstein learned that Hilbert was also working on the field equations and redoubled his own efforts. During November 1915, Einstein published several papers culminating in The Field Equations of Gravitation (see Einstein field equations). Nearly simultaneously, David Hilbert published "The Foundations of Physics", an axiomatic derivation of the field equations. Hilbert fully credited Einstein as the originator of the theory, and no public priority dispute concerning the field equations ever arose between the two men during their lives. </li>
      <li>Additionally, Hilbert's work anticipated and assisted several advances in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. His work was a key aspect of Hermann Weyl and John von Neumann's work on the mathematical equivalence of Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and Erwin Schrödinger's wave equation, and his namesake Hilbert space plays an important part in quantum theory. In 1926, von Neumann showed that, if quantum states were understood as vectors in Hilbert space, they would correspond with both Schrödinger's wave function theory and Heisenberg's matrices.

Throughout this immersion in physics, Hilbert worked on putting rigor into the mathematics of physics. While highly dependent on higher mathematics, physicists tended to be "sloppy" with it. To a "pure" mathematician like Hilbert, this was both ugly, and difficult to understand. As he began to understand physics and how physicists were using mathematics, he developed a coherent mathematical theory for what he found – most importantly in the area of integral equations. When his colleague Richard Courant wrote the now classic Methoden der mathematischen Physik [Methods of Mathematical Physics] including some of Hilbert's ideas, he added Hilbert's name as author even though Hilbert had not directly contributed to the writing. Hilbert said <b> "Physics is too hard for physicists",</b> implying that the necessary mathematics was generally beyond them; the Courant-Hilbert book made it easier for them. </li>
     
      <li> <i> "Who among us would not be happy to <b> lift the veil behind which is hidden the future; to gaze at the coming developments of our science and at the secrets of its development in the centuries to come?</b> What will be the ends toward which the spirit of future generations of mathematicians will tend? What methods, what new facts will the new century reveal in the vast and rich field of mathematical thought?" </i> </li>
